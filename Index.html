                    Hi, my name is Nolan Chow. I was born in Vancouver, BC, but lived in Hong Kong throughout
                    most of my childhood. To be precise, I left when I was two years old and returned during my
                    fifth year in elementary school. Swimming is something I enjoy from time to time, but recently
                    I have not been to the pool much. I don't have a dog, but I <strong>love</strong> corgis. 
                    I also make a habit of <em>only</em> drinking banana milk in the morning.
                </p>
